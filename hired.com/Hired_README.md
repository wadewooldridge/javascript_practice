Coding challenges for Hired.com signup. They require completion of the first 2, then 1 of the final 3.

Initial email context:

Before we approve your profile, we'll need you to take the Hired technical assessment -- a timed challenge that usually takes 60-90 minutes to complete, and includes logic, data structure and algorithm questions. Essentially this test is designed to give us a sense of your coding performance. Once you take the test, our team will get back to you shortly thereafter.

Please complete the test within two weeks of receiving this email. If for some reason you need an extension, please let us know so that we can adjust your testing window.

Below are some important things to remember when completing this exercise:

-- Due to the large number of applications, you cannot take the test a second time. So make sure that you start the test when you know you'll be interruption free for the 60-90 minutes. Really. -- At a minimum, you need to complete three total challenges -- the first two challenges and any one of the following tests that you feel comfortable with. That said, the more information we have about your coding abilities, the better so complete as many tests as you have time to do well. --The technical assessment is available in 8 different coding languages (Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript, C, Scala, PHP, C#, C++). At the start of the test, choose the language from the menu in the top right corner that aligns best with the future role you desire. For example, if you want to be a Data Scientist, choose Python. If you want to do frontend work, choose Javascript. --You'll be able to take a practice exam before you begin to become familiar with the interface. Simply click "Take the the demo test" to explore the interface with no pressure. --To prove that your work is authentic please code using our web-based editor instead of writing the code in an external one. Otherwise our system might flag you as a cheater and no one wants that.
